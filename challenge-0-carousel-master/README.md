The Silmarillion, now published four years after the death of its author, is an
account of the Elder Days, or the First Age of the World. In The Lord of the
Rings were narrated the great events at the end of the Third Age; but the tales
of The Silmarillion are legends deriving from a much deeper past, when Morgoth,
the first Dark Lord, dwelt in Middle-earth, and the High Elves made war upon
him for the recovery of the Silmarils
